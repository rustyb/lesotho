Today was our last day on site with our planners. It started out as a scorcher with the mercury touching over 33 degrees celsius today.

We collected over 120 points of interest in the two hours and as you can see the map is very rapidly becoming filled with useful data for the planners to use in their day to day work.


The information collected today consisted of the location of various facilities such as septic tanks, telephone poles, shops, boundary walls, latrines and many more points.

**More updates to follow this evening the signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Lesotho Government and Fingal County Council.
